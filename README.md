# EchoVR Crash Handler
----
## Usage
This script intially assumes the default path of echoVR so if your game is installed in the default location, it should work without any setup.
>Default location for the game is: C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\ready-at-dawn-echo-arena\bin\win7\echovr.exe

If your game is installed on another drive you need to change the path in the text file named: "echopath.txt" with your path to the game.
>If you need to find your install location you can go to your oculus library, click the three dots on EchoVR, click details. Here you should see your Location. 

If you click the path it will give you C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\ready-at-dawn-echo-arena\ so you need to append it with bin\win7\echovr.exe to make it the full path to the .exe
